# Spam SMS Classification ðŸ”” âš  âœ”

### Libraries
1. NumPy
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib
4. Scikit Learn 
  * Feature Extraction : Count Vectorizer and TF IDF Vectorizer
  * Model Selection : Train Test Split, Grid Search Cross Validation and K Fold Cross Validation
  * Ensembles : Random Forest Classifier and Gradient Boosting Classifier
5. NLTK ( Corpus, Stopwords, Porter Stemmer, Word Net Lemmatizer )
6. String ( Punctuation )
7. RE : Regular Expression

### Features
1. SMS ( Messages Extracted in form of `TSV` )
2. Labels ( **Spam** or **Ham** )

### Machine Learning Pipeline

### 1. **Import** Data ( SMS )

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**

### 3. **Data Cleaning**

- Remove Punctuation.
- Change to Lowercase.
- Tokenization : **Splitting** a Phrase | Sentence into List of **Individual Words** called **Tokens**.
- Remove Stopwords : Most Common Words ( Filtered out before processing Natural Language Data )
- Stemming ( Speed ) | Lemmatization ( Accuracy ) : Reduce the Word to its Base | Stem Form.

### 4. **Feature Engineering**

- Vectorization : Convert Text to Numbers ( Feature Vectors )  that an Algorithm and a ML Model can Understand and Learn.
- CountVectorizer : Extract Features from Text ( Count Occurence of Text in Corpus and Consider each as Feature | Column )
- Bag of Words : Count Occurence of the Word in each Document and each Word becomes Feature Represented by a Vector. 
- TF-IDF : Represents **Importance** of the Word in the Document. 
- Term Frequency : Number of Time the Term Appears in the Document. 
- Inverse Document Frequency : Number of Documents containing the Word.

### 5. **Fit** | **Train** Base Model

### 6. **Tune Hyperparameters** and **Evaluate** with **Grid Search Cross Validation**

### 7. Final **Model Selection** ( Comparing Models and Selecting Best One ) Accuracy : 97%

### Process
1. **Split** the Data into **Training** Set and **Test** Set.
2. Train **Vectorizers** on Training Set and Use that to Transform **Test** Set.
3. Fit Best **Random Forest Model** and Best **Gradient Boosting Model** on **Training Set** and **Predict** on **Test Set**.
4. **Evaluate** Results of these Two Models to Select **Best Model**.
